# Pixel Platformer Engine - A Lightweight and Efficient 2D Pixel Platformer Game Engine

✨ **Pixel Platformer Engine** - A 2D pixel-style platformer game engine fully developed with Pygame, built-in visual map editor, no complex configuration required, ready to use out of the box. It helps developers quickly understand and learn how to use Python to build their own side-scrolling platformer games, achieving a breakthrough from 0 to 1!

It is an excellent Python project for beginners and enthusiasts to practice small game development! Whether it's for rapid prototype building and understanding, learning small game project architecture, applying Pygame and Flask libraries, or referencing for small independent game development, this engine project can meet your needs. It saves you the time of reinventing the wheel, allowing you to focus on learning and implementing Pygame small game architecture, gameplay and creativity.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Zero Threshold to Get Started**: Simple project structure, clear code logic, can be started with just one command, even beginners can quickly get started and debug.
- **Visual Map Editing**: Built-in map editor, no need to manually write JSON, drag-and-drop operation to create levels, and preview map effects in real time.
- **Complete and Extensible Functions**: Integrates core functions such as side-scrolling jumping, enemy AI, Boss mechanism, and item system. Modular code design allows easy expansion of new gameplay.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Developed based on Pygame, small in size, smooth in operation, compatible with most devices, no complex development environment configuration required.
- **MIT Open Source License**: Fully open source, code and game materials can be freely used, modified and distributed, both for commercial and non-commercial use, without any restrictions.

## 🎮 Core Features

- Basic Gameplay: Side-scrolling platform jumping, crouching, pausing, with smooth operation and good feel.
- AI System: Built-in enemy AI logic, supports custom enemy behaviors, and easily realizes combat mechanisms.
- Boss Mechanism: Reserved Boss battle interface, can quickly develop exclusive Boss levels and skills.
- Item System: Supports item pickup and use, can expand various item effects (health recovery, speed boost, etc.).
- Map Parsing: Supports JSON format map files, which can be manually written or generated with the editor, enabling flexible level switching.
- Visual Editor: What you see is what you get, drag and drop to place terrain, enemies and items to quickly build game levels.
